## What is the point of Supernovel?

> *A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star. A supernova occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star, or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion.*
>"Supernova", Wikipedia

Okay so that's not *exactly* what Supernovel is... 

Supernovel is a website template built with writers in mind. It's built to be both customizable and approachable to non-techy individuals. We've baked in some key features we think you'll like to, such as:

**WIP TODO FOR GRAY**
- [x] Home page (synopsis, credits)
- [x] Chapter index page and chapter collection system
- [ ] Author's updates page (for news and announcements)
- [x] About the author page (you know what this is smh)
- [ ] Preset color schemes (parchment, deep blue, Catppuccin, etc.) on docs to paste in `variables.css`
- [ ] Side-by-side component for illustation
- [ ] Preset text spacers
- [x] Custom audio to play for releases
- [ ] Custom audio to play for home page
- [ ] Side and bottom release navigation arrows
- [ ] Background image support for main pages and release pages

Many writers without much technical expertise still use stuff like Wordpress, Blogspot and other old school ways of the web. While these still rock, and provide a lot of ease of use, they're not as fast and efficient as many modern ways to make websites. **That's where Supernovel comes in**.

## For the Techy ones...

It's built on modern tech like [Astro](), [Tailwind]() and [Bun]() - and extensible beyond measure. 

## For the Not So Techy ones...

It's ready to go out of the box. With an easy to follow guide, you can get up and running in less than a day - stay focused on your words rather than website issues. On top of that, we even offer a section of the guide so you can hook up an Obsidian Vault to the website, meaning you can write all your words and immediately ship it to your website and the click of a button. No large file transfers, just write your words in Markdown and get ready for your very own website just for your writing!
